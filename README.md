# Project 1: FizzBuzz
___
## Objective 
The project is a task that is to be solved using two approaches:  
1. *Logic-based* approach (Software 1.0)
2. *Deep learning* approach (Software 2.0).
It is also designed to quickly gain familiarity with neural network basics, Python and Machine Learning frameworks.  
___
## Task
We consider the task of FizzBuzz. In this task an integer divisible by 3 is printed as Fizz, and integer divisible by 5 is printed as Buzz.  
An integer divisible by both 3 and 5 is printed as FizzBuzz. The programs will be tested on how well they perform in converting integers from 1 to 100 to the FizzBuzz labels.  
1. **Logic-based:**  
Implement the logic in Python using standard logic (if-then-else statements using modulo arithmetic). The program will presumably work perfectly on all 100 input integers.
2. **Machine Learning:** First create a training data set for numbers ranging from 101 to 1000. We avoid training on integers 1 to 100 because that forms the testing set. To design the learning program, make decisions on the neural network architecture *(no. of layers, no of units per layer)*, hyper-parameters such as the *learning rate, number of epochs, loss function, regularizer, etc.*  
Implement it using any of the alternative machine learning frameworks such as Pytorch, Keras and Gluon.
